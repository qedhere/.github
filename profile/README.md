# QED
Q.E.D. or QED is an [initialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialism) of the [Latin phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_phrases_(full)) *"quod erat demonstrandum"*.    
Literally it states *"what was to be shown"*. 

Traditionally, the abbreviation is placed at the end of 
[mathematical proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof#Ending_a_proof) and   
philosophical arguments in print publications, to indicate that the   
proof or the argument is complete.
